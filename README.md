## Dependency Injection Examples

### Personal Notes
**Spring Context (Application Context)** - The ApplicationContext is the _thing_ that understands the user's wishes in terms of where and what should be injected. We can go in and ask the application context for a reference of an object. 

**IOC** - Inversion of control. We pass the control to the framework. Is a technique to allow dependencies to be injected at runtime.

**DI** - Dependency Injection. Some say you avoid declaring objects using "new". Types of DI: By class properties(least preferred), by setters, by constructors(more preferred).
